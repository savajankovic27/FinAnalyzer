The primary goal of this project is to analyze the different datasets (such as stock prices, portfolio returns, revenues/expenses for a company) stored in .csv files. Throughout the project, I will:

-Load raw CSV files (such as stock price history or transactional data).

-Clean and preprocess the data.

-Compute relevant metrics (daily returns, cumulative returns, moving averages).

-Perform simple time-series analyses and create summary reports.

-Visualize trends in prices, returns, and potentially correlation between assets.
