# Comprehensive Stock Analysis & Forecasting Project

**Project Overview:**  
This project provides a full pipeline for analyzing stock price data, computing technical indicators, building predictive models, and creating interactive dashboards. I have used `AAPL` (Apple Inc.) as an example, but the framework can easily be extended to other tickers that you'd like to add. 

Note that the stock data has been downloaded from Kaggle. 

## Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**  
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  
- **Technical Indicators:**  
  Compute a range of indicators, including Moving Averages (SMA & EMA), RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and Stochastic Oscillator.
  
- **Advanced Feature Engineering:**  
  
- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Use Plotly for interactive charts, including candlesticks, volume overlays, and adjustable date ranges.
  
- **Forecasting Models:**  
  Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average-Based model generation. 
  
- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Build a Panel-based dashboard for selecting stocks, adjusting indicators, and exploring data visually. Not fully developed... yet
