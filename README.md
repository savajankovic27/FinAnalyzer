# Comprehensive Stock Analysis & Forecasting Project

**Project Overview:**  
This project provides a full pipeline for analyzing stock price data, computing technical indicators, building predictive models, and creating interactive dashboards. I have used `AAPL` (Apple Inc.) as an example, but the framework can easily be extended to other tickers that you'd like to add. 

Note that the stock data has been downloaded from Kaggle.
